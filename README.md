# Scope and Closure Challenge

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## JavaScript Foundations

## Scope and Closures

## Objectives

- Explain function scope
- Describe what closure is, how closure is created in a program and why it is important to understand closures in JavaScript  

## Introduction

This challenge focuses on both scope and closures.

In this challenge you will be working to build a `scoreboard` (in the console) that takes randomly generated data and keeps track of a game's progress. If you're not familiar with the rules of baseball what you need to know is this: there are 9 innings and teams take turns "at-bat." Teams can only score while they are at bat. A team stops being at bat once they have gotten 3 `outs` by either striking out or through game play. You can read more about baseball rules [here](https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/baseball.html).

A scoreboard in a major league stadium looks something like this. In fact, the scoreboard at Fenway Park in Boston is actually quite famous.

There are layers upon layers of nested functions within the game of baseball. Your challenge today will be to work through tasks associated with these layers, and ultimately to produce a scoreboard that logs in the console.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set Up Project and Tests

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github
2. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!)
3. `cd` into your newly cloned repository
4. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`
5. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual

### Task 2a - MVP code

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks.

### Task 2b - Written questions

Edit the `ReadMe` file with your answers.

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).
  Closure in Javascript is when you use a function to return a function with its own private variables that cannot be accessed outside of said function.

2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?
  Closure is used in the function definition of personalDice. It returns a function.

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?
  The substring \`${name} rolled a \` will always be the same. The newRoll variable is randomized each time the function is called, so it could theoretically always be the same, but it is randomized, so it should change if called an infinite number of times.

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`? 
  The lexical scope is the scope of the function returned by personalDice and the personalDice function itself.

### Task 2c - Exit Ticket

Once you begin, you will have 15 minutes to answer the questions [here](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/WjSzNh9gDrD8Xn8hw/enY3yPRP3nEm7E).

The completion of these questions is mandatory for MVP. However, passing the quiz doesn't affect your standing as a Lambda School student whatsoever. This is Lambda School testing itself! Please answer honestly and to the best of your ability without using external references.

### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

```js
(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
```
  Output:
  ```
  a defined? false
  b defined? false
  ```

2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```
```js
function createBase(base) {
  const base = base;
  return function(num) {
    return base + num;
  };
};
```


3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!
  Functional programming uses functions as the basis for complex operations, whereas object-oriented programming (OOP) uses objects. This means that whereas in OOP all objects are subtypes of other objects (the ultimate parent of all objects being a global Object) that inherit properties and methods from their parents, in functional programming, you work with functions that usually interact with other functions to achieve their purpose; these include higher order functions that return a function themselves and/or make use of a callback function that is provided as an argument. Functional programming is usually best utilized when there is a large amount of data which all needs to be manipulated in the same way, and OOP is best utilized when you have multiple sets of data that must be manipulated in different ways. JavaScript utilizes both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms to give the greatest amount of flexibility to the user.
